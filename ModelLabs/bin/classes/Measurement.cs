    ///The PSR - Measurement association is intended to capture this use of Measurement and is included in the naming hierarchy based on EquipmentContainer. The naming hierarchy typically has Measurements as leafs, e.g. Substation-VoltageLevel-Bay-Switch-Measurement.

Instead it is captured by the Measurement - Terminal association that is used to define the sensing location in the network topology.
